# Ad Critique Exercise

The goal of this exercise is to critique your group members advertisements, and get critiqe for your advertisement. Then, edit your advertisement based on the feedback you received.

Like the critique we've done in the past, remember to ask non-judgemental questions, such as: "What was your goal for this work?" or "What do you want people to notice first?". Be sure to acknowledge positive aspects of the videos, and provide concrete suggestions for improvement.


## Process

1.  Post a link to your github page with your video to make it easier to find the video. Then gather around a laptop, so you can hear the audio component of the advertisement. 

2.  As a group, watch then critique each of the advertisements.

    -   Have the creator start with brief explanation of their goals and decision-making process for the advertisement, as well as any specific aspects of the work they're unhappy with or would like feedback on.

    -   Each member of the group should offer at least one positive comment about the advertisement, and at least one suggestion for improvement. (You may also ask neutral questions about the work.)

    -   The creator should avoid explaining or defending their design decisions; instead, focus on listening and understanding what people tell you. Ask clarifying questions if you want, and take lots of notes.

3.  If you have time left after the critique process, you can begin work on the final edit of your advertisement.

## Submitting Your Work

You will need to upload another page to your github repo at `igme110/videoCritique/index.html` that has the following things

1.   A description of the process you used to create your advertisement, make sure to address the design goals
2.   An explanation of how the critique process shaped your revisions.
3.  Your critique notes from each of your group members.

You can find a sample template [here](index.html) (right click, and `Save Link As` to download)

Submit a link to the page with your final video to the dropbox `Exercise - Video Critique` on MyCourses.
