# Web Site Design

Today you'll begin the design of your website project, starting with a simple design document that focuses on the content and structure of your site.

## HOMEWORK

Before class on **10/17**, upload at least 1 visual mockup of your site.

## Content and Structure

Your website should be a portfolio for you to show off, it should be a place for your to display work that you're proud of. It might have a page about a project that you wrked on that you're really proud of, and another page to work as a resume. I'm open to other approaches, as well; those are just some possible examples.

Start your design process by thinking about the goal of your site--what do you want to communicate to your audience about yourself? What information will you need to provide in order to accomplish that?

Next, create a simple flowchart diagram showing the pages on the site, and what content you think will go onto each of them. You can sketch this by hand, or use a tool like Google Drawings (available in Google Drive).

Finally, create a basic wireframe for how you want your pages to be laid out. Where will the navigation be? How will your content be organized? I strongly suggest sketching these on paper or on a whiteboard, and then taking a photo of the one(s) you like when you're done; it's much more effective than starting with a computer.

I'll post some examples of my plans for my personal website redesign.

## Deliverables

Combine the three components into a single document, and upload it to the dropbox in myCourses. By next class **(10/22)**
