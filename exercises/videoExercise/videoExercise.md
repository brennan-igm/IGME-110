# Digital Video Editing Exercise
This week you'll be continuing your advertisement video, we're focusing on the video editing aspect this week.

For this exercise you might need to find a second video source, if you don't already have one.


## Requirements
Your video must meet the following requirements:
1. Video must be atleast 30 seconds long.
2. Video must have at least 2 different video sources.
3. Video must have at least 4 cuts
4. Video must have text, of some form, and use of at least one filter/effect


## Rendering your Video
BEFORE RENDERING: Save your project, and ensure that it is properly saved. Sometimes rendering can cause the program to crash and you might lose some or all of your work.

Once you have edited your video and saved your project, you will need to "render" it out to a single file that you can share. To do this, go to `File>Export Video...` In the Export window, pick either the `H.264 Baseline Profile` or the `YouTube` option. Then click the `Export File` button.

Exporting should take a few seconds. If it takes more than a minute, something is probably wrong or your video is too long. Let me know if it seems like the program has frozen.


## Submitting Your Work
You will need to upload a page to your GitHub repo at `igme110/video/index.html` that has the following things:
1.  A rendered version of your trailer (see above for details on rendering in Premiere).
2.  A screenshot of your project timeline in Shotcut (or a different video editor of your choice)
3.  A text document explaining your intent / thought process in creating the video (3 sentences or less).
4. Links to all sources used in the video (anything you didn't make).

You can find a sample template [here](index.html)
