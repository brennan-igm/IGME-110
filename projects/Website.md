# Resource Web Site

In this assignment, you will create a website about yourself, and a few things that you've worked on.

This project is due on **Sunday, November 3rd, at 11:59pm**

## Site Requirements

-   The files for your site should be in your GitHub Pages project directory. (We will cover how to do this in week 9.)
-   The main page should be called index.html, and should include a title with the site topic and a relevant image, a brief introduction to yourself.
-   The site should use a consistent visual design, using principles of color, layout and typography discussed in class.
-   There should be a minimum of three pages in addition to the main index page: They should consist of 3 things that you've worked on. The examples are 1: your research paper, 2: your magazine cover, and 3: something you worked on outside of this class. Your projects don't necessarily need to be from this class, those two are just examples.
-   Each of the pages should have navigation links to the other pages on the site
-   Each of the pages should include at least one appropriate image (a photograph, a logo, etc).
-   Your project pages should have a description of the project, and some info about your work on it.
-   You may use templates and/or code libraries from other sources, provided that they are explicitly made available for re-use, and you clearly indicate and link back to what you used on the sources page.
-   All pages must properly validate for both HTML and CSS. We will use the W3C [HTML](https://validator.w3.org) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validators to check this.

    If you use my template, or code from other sites as part of your HTML and/or CSS, you _**MUST**_ describe and provide a link to that source on your sources page. You also must make meaningful changes to the template (at a minimum changes to colors and typefaces) so that I know you understand how it is constructed and that you've engaged in a design process.

    You may use find some template code [here](web-project-template)
